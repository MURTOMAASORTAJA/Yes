## The best drum sequencer in this solar system

![Yes](https://github.com/MURTOMAASORTAJA/Yes/blob/main/readme.jpg?raw=true)

I have a dream about a hardware drum sequencer. It would be the best and using it felt like pouring liquid winnership and success on your face.

Essentially it would look and feel like the sequencer on Arturia Drumbrute, which is almost perfect.

Main principles and features:

- none of that menu madness; only buttons and knobs doing what they promise
- size isn't an issue, so knobs and buttons can be sturdy, big and mean
- has to be the best so well that the very existence of it insults other drum sequencers

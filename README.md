## The best drum sequencer in this solar system

![Yes](https://github.com/MURTOMAASORTAJA/Yes/blob/main/readme.jpg?raw=true)

I have a dream about a hardware drum sequencer. It would be the best and using it felt like pouring liquid winnership and success on your face.

Main principles and features:

- none of that menu madness; only buttons and knobs doing what they promise
- size isn't an issue, so knobs and buttons can be sturdy, big and mean
- has to be the best so well that the very existence of it insults other drum sequencers
- inputs and outputs midi for clock and notes
- everything, knobs, buttons and other interface elements as big and sturdy as they can be
- best
